# How to preprocess miRNA-seq with FastQC and cutadapt

Aim: conduct research on miRNA 

Data: from EBL 

## FastQC / Fastp
Deal with miRNA sequence, Fastp tool can not detect adapters, which can be detected by FastQC. Here is an example.

Tips:
1.If you run FastQC with Linux command, run with file names; otherwise it will print errors
